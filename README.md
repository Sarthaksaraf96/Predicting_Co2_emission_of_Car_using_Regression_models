Working with Fuel Consuptions data of many cars, I have Tried 2 Regression models for predcition of CO2 emission with features such as ENGINESIZE','CYLINDERS','FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB','FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY','FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY','FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB_MPG' 
1) Simple Linear Regression : Simple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line. Both variables should be quantitative.
Output of SLR:

2) Multiple Linear Regression : Multiple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between a quantitative dependent variable and two or more independent variables

Comparing Output:
